## 📊 About the Project

This app uses a trained ML pipeline built using **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** regressors to predict the final score of a batting team in a T20 match.

The features used include:
- Batting team
- Bowling team
- Match city
- Overs completed
- Runs scored so far
- Wickets fallen
- Runs in the last 5 overs
